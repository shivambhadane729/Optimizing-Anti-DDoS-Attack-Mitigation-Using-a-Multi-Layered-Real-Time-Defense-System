Optimizing Anti-DDoS Attack Mitigation Using a Multi-Layered Real-Time Defense System

üõ°Ô∏è Overview
This project implements a comprehensive, multi-layered real-time defense system designed to effectively detect, mitigate, and prevent Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. By integrating cutting-edge technologies like Machine Learning (ML) for anomaly detection, traffic filtering, and dynamic load balancing, the system provides a robust, scalable, and resilient solution. The primary goal is to maintain high service availability and operational stability even under intense malicious traffic surges.

‚ú® Key Features
Our defense system is built upon the following core components, each serving as a critical defense layer:

üß† ML-Based Anomaly Detection:
Utilizes the Isolation Forest algorithm for unsupervised learning to profile normal traffic and swiftly detect subtle or sudden abnormal traffic patterns indicative of a DDoS attack (e.g., volumetric, protocol, or application-layer attacks).

This layer enables proactive defense before an attack escalates.

‚è± Rate Limiting & Throttling:

Implements fine-grained control over incoming traffic (IP address, connection rate, etc.) to control traffic spikes, prevent bot floods, and neutralize low-and-slow DDoS attempts.

‚öñ Load Balancing (Layer 4/7):

Dynamically distributes incoming requests across multiple backend servers to maximize resource utilization and prevent any single point of failure from being overwhelmed.

Ensures service continuity and stability during peak traffic, both malicious and legitimate.

üîê Firewall Integration (iptables):

Leverages low-level, high-performance OS-based packet filtering using iptables (or similar Linux firewall tools).

Enables rapid and automated blocking of malicious IP addresses identified by the ML layer or based on known attack signatures.

üçØ Honeypot Diversion:

Deploys low-interaction honeypots to trap and analyze malicious traffic, gathering threat intelligence, and diverting attack resources away from critical production assets.

üìä Real-Time Monitoring & Dashboard:

A centralized visualization dashboard (e.g., using Grafana/Prometheus) for tracking key metrics:

Traffic volume and type (legitimate vs. flagged).

Attack attempt statistics and mitigation effectiveness.

System resource utilization and load distribution.
