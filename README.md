Optimizing Anti-DDoS Attack Mitigation Using a Multi-Layered Real-Time Defense System

📌 Overview
This project implements a multi-layered real-time defence system to detect, mitigate, and prevent Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. By combining machine learning, traffic filtering, load balancing, and honeypots, the system provides a scalable and resilient solution to maintain service availability under malicious traffic surges.

⚡ Features
🧠 ML-Based Anomaly Detection – Detects abnormal traffic patterns using Isolation Forest.
⏱ Rate Limiting – Controls traffic spikes and prevents bot floods.
⚖ Load Balancing – Distributes requests across multiple backend servers for stability.
🔐 Firewall Integration – Uses iptables for packet filtering and IP blocking.
📊 Real-Time Monitoring – Dashboard for tracking traffic and attack attempts.
